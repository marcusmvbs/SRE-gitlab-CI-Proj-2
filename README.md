The main goal of this project, it is to use tools such as terraform, ansible, gitlab cicd, to provision an infrastructure as code in the google cloud provider, that hosts a nginx webserver, with nginx ingress controller as load balancer, applied with Helm charts in the kubernetes cluster.

I am glad I could dedicate some time to create a diagram of the whole process, to grasp the content in a visual way, for better understanding all the abstractions related to cloud infrastructure, with tools largely adopted in SRE/devops roles.

This project was created for study purposes. Improvements on service account usability, kubernetes features, python automation, safety best practices, ansible configuration, istio, prometheus and database sql implementations will come later.
